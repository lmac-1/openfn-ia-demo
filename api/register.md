# Decoupling register

The [second decoupling experiment](https://github.com/OpenFn/context/tree/main/lightning/brandon/decoupling-experiment-v2)
designed a 16-service API for Lightning (`api-reqs/`). This register lists every
method from that design, one line each, and records where it stands in this API.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Public** | This API already has it, as designed. |
| **Private** | Lightning can do it in the app today, and this API specifies it as a Private endpoint, with an implementation note on how the code differs. |
| **Partial** | This API has it, but without something the design calls for. The endpoint's section lists the gap under "Planned additional scope". |
| **Planned** | Lightning can't do this yet, or the part that does this job isn't there. Specified as a Planned endpoint or field. |
| **Misfit** | Doesn't belong in this API. [Misfits](./misfits.md) says why. |

The design's paths are its own, not this API's: it has no `/api` prefix, and
it addresses some nested resources at the top level. The "This API" column
gives the route here.

The design was for a React app replacing Lightning's pages. Its sign-in,
account and AI methods map to routes that take a
[session token](./authentication.md#session-tokens), the planned token kind
for Lightning's own app. Where an existing or planned route already does a
method's job, the method maps to it rather than getting a route of its own,
and its notes say what part of that route does the job.

Rows in the design's verification tables that aren't methods (domain
libraries, background workers, "no public endpoint" notes) are left out.
