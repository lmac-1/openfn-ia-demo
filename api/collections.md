# Collections

A collection is a named key-value store inside a project. There are two APIs:
one manages the collection itself, the other reads and writes its items.

## Get a collection

Status: **Public**

```
GET /api/projects/:project_id/collections/:id
```

Tokens: personal access token of a project owner or admin, or service account
with `collections:write`.

```json
{ "data": { "id": "…", "project_id": "…", "name": "patients" } }
```

Planned additional scope: `byte_size_sum`, the bytes the collection's keys and
values take up, which is what counts against the plan's storage limit.

## Create or rename a collection

Status: **Public**

```
PUT /api/projects/:project_id/collections/:id
```

Tokens: personal access token of a project owner or admin, or service account
with `collections:write`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Required. Unique within the project. Lowercase letters and digits, separated by `-`, `_` or `.`. |
| `id` | UUID | Optional. Must match the path if sent. |

Creates the collection under `:id`, or renames the one that has it and keeps
its items. Answers 201 on create and 200 on rename, with the same shape as
`GET`.

Notable errors:

- 409 `id_taken` when the id belongs to a collection in another project.
- 409 `taken` when the name is already used in the project.
- 402 `exceeds_limit` when creating would go over the plan's limit.

Planned additional scope: a superuser's personal access token, and moving a
collection to another project by sending its `id` under the new project's
path, instead of answering 409 `id_taken`. The superuser page at
`/settings/collections` can already do this: its edit form has a project
picker, and `Lightning.Collections.update_collection/2` casts `project_id`.

## List a project's collections

Status: **Private**

```
GET /api/projects/:project_id/collections
```

Tokens: personal access token of a project owner or admin, or service account
with `collections:write`. Paged.

| Parameter | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `sort` | `name` (the default) or `byte_size_sum`, with a `-` prefix for descending. |

Each collection has `byte_size_sum`, the bytes its keys and values take up.

```json
{
  "data": [{ "id": "…", "project_id": "…", "name": "patients", "byte_size_sum": 20480 }],
  "links": { "self": "…", "first": "…", "last": "…", "next": null, "prev": null }
}
```

> Implementation note: `Lightning.Collections.list_project_collections/2`,

> (`LightningWeb.ProjectLive.CollectionsComponent`) calls on load and on its
> `sort` event. It returns whole collection records, `byte_size_sum`
> included, and takes `order_by`, which the tab sets to `name` or
> `byte_size_sum` in either direction. Differences: it isn't paged.

## List every collection

Status: **Private**

```
GET /api/collections
```

Tokens: personal access token of a superuser, or service account with
`collections:write`. Paged.

Lists the collections of every project on the instance, in the same shape as
the project list, with `project_name` added. Takes the same `sort`.

> Implementation note: `Lightning.Collections.list_collections/1`, which the
> superuser page at `/settings/collections` (`LightningWeb.CollectionLive.Index`)
> calls on mount and on its `sort` event. It preloads `:project`, so the

> or `byte_size_sum` in either direction. Differences:

> - it does no authorisation check. The page is limited to superusers by the
>   `:ensure_admin` hook (`:access_admin_space` in `Lightning.Policies.Users`),
>   so the route has to check the token itself.

## Delete a collection

Status: **Private**

```
DELETE /api/projects/:project_id/collections/:id
```

Tokens: personal access token of a project owner or admin, or service account
with `collections:write`.

Deletes the collection and every item in it. Answers 204 with no body.

> Implementation note: `Lightning.Collections.delete_collection/1` takes only
> the collection id. Differences: it takes no actor, so it records no audit
> event, and it doesn't check the collection belongs to the path's project.
> The route has to do both.

## Collection items

These routes address a collection by name. If more than one project you can
see has a collection with that name, add `?project_id=…`, or you get 409
`ambiguous_name`.

Tokens: personal access token or run token. A run can only reach its own
project's collections. With a personal access token, reading needs any role in
the project, writing needs editor or above, and deleting many items at once
needs owner or admin. Service account support is planned.

Writes that would go over the plan's storage limit answer 402 `exceeds_limit`.

An item looks like this. `value` is always a string; store JSON by encoding it
yourself.

```json
{ "key": "patient-001", "value": "{\"age\": 42}", "created": "…", "updated": "…" }
```

### Get one item

Status: **Public**

```
GET /collections/:name/:key
```

Answers 200 with the item, or 204 with no body if the key doesn't exist.

### Stream items

Status: **Public**

```
GET /collections/:name
```

| Parameter | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `key` | A key pattern to match. `*` is a wildcard, for example `patient-*`. |
| `limit` | Items to return. Defaults to the instance's stream limit. |
| `cursor` | The `cursor` from the previous response, to get the next batch. |
| `created_after`, `created_before` | ISO 8601 timestamps. |
| `updated_after`, `updated_before` | ISO 8601 timestamps. |
| `project_id` | Only to pick between collections with the same name. |

Any other parameter answers 400 `invalid_parameter` with an `unknown_key`
entry.

```json
{ "items": [ { "key": "…", "value": "…", "created": "…", "updated": "…" } ], "cursor": "MTIz" }
```

`cursor` is `null` when there are no more items.

> `:access_collection` like this one. It sends every item as one JSON array,
> as a file named `<name>.json`. There is no API route for that; page through
> this route with `cursor` and build the file instead.

### Put one item

Status: **Public**

```
PUT /collections/:name/:key
```

Body: `{"value": "<string>"}`. Answers `{"upserted": 1, "error": null}`. A
missing or invalid value answers 422.

### Put many items

Status: **Public**

```
POST /collections/:name
```

Body: `{"items": [{"key": "…", "value": "…"}, …]}`. Answers
`{"upserted": <count>, "error": null}`. If any item is invalid, nothing is
written and the 422 has an entry for each bad item, for example
`#/items/3/key` with `duplicate` for a key that appears twice.

### Delete one item

Status: **Public**

```
DELETE /collections/:name/:key
```

Answers `{"key": "<key>", "deleted": 1}`, or `"deleted": 0` if the key didn't
exist.

### Delete many items

Status: **Public**

```
DELETE /collections/:name
DELETE /collections/:name?key=patient-*
```

Without `key`, deletes every item. With `key`, deletes the items matching the
pattern. Answers `{"key": <pattern or null>, "deleted": <count>}`.
