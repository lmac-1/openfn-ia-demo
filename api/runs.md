# Runs

## List and get runs

Status: **Public**

Tokens: personal access token. Read only. Service account support is planned.

```
GET /api/runs
GET /api/runs?project_id=:project_id
GET /api/projects/:project_id/runs
GET /api/runs/:id
GET /api/projects/:project_id/runs/:id
```

Getting one run answers for any run in a project the caller can access; the
nested route doesn't check that the run belongs to `:project_id`.

Lists are paged, newest first by `inserted_at`, and take these filters:

| Parameter | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `workflow_id`, `work_order_id` | UUIDs. |
| `state` | Comma-separated: `available`, `claimed`, `started`, `success`, `failed`, `crashed`, `cancelled`, `killed`, `exception`, `lost`. |
| `inserted_after`, `inserted_before` | ISO 8601. |
| `updated_after`, `updated_before` | ISO 8601. |

Every bad filter is reported together in one 400 `invalid_parameter`. An
unknown `project_id` answers 404.

Each run (`priority` is `immediate` or `normal`):

```json
{
  "type": "runs",
  "id": "…",
  "attributes": {
    "state": "failed",
    "started_at": "…",
    "finished_at": "…",
    "priority": "normal",
    "error_type": "RuntimeCrash"
  },
  "relationships": {},
  "links": { "self": "https://.../api/runs/…" }
}
```

Planned additional scope:

- `inserted_at`, when the run was queued. The `inserted_after` and
  `inserted_before` filters already use it.
- The ids the run points at: `work_order_id`, `starting_job_id` or
  `starting_trigger_id` (where it started), `created_by_id` (the user who
  started or retried it, or `null` for a trigger) and `snapshot_id` (the
  workflow version it ran).
- `snapshot_lock_version`, so a client can tell a run on the latest version of
  its workflow from one on an older version.
- `created_by_email` and `starting_trigger_type` (`webhook` or `cron`), what
  the run page shows under "Started by".

## Cancel a run

Status: **Private**

```
PATCH /api/runs/:id
```

Tokens: personal access token of a project owner, admin or editor.

Body: `{"state": "cancelled"}`. No other field or state is accepted. Answers
200 with the run.

Only a run that hasn't been claimed by a worker yet (state `available`) can be
cancelled. Any other run answers 422 `invalid` with a `not_allowed` entry at
`#/state`.

> Implementation note: `Lightning.Runs.cancel_run/1` cancels one available run
> and returns `{:error, :not_available}` otherwise.
> `Lightning.WorkOrders.cancel_many/2` cancels every available run of several
> work orders. Differences: neither takes an actor or records an audit event.

## Retry a run

Status: **Private**

```
POST /api/runs/:id/retries
```

Tokens: personal access token of a project owner, admin or editor.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `step_id` | UUID | Required. The step to retry from. It must belong to this run. |

Creates a new run on the same work order, starting from that step. Steps that
don't depend on it are carried over rather than run again. Answers 201 with the
new run, in the same shape as `GET /api/runs/:id`.

Notable errors:

- 422 `invalid` with a `not_found` entry at `#/step_id` when the step isn't in
  this run.
- 422 `invalid` with a `dataclip_wiped` entry when the step's input has been
  wiped.
- 409 `scheduled_for_deletion` when the workflow has been deleted.
- 429 `too_many_runs` or 402 `exceeds_limit` for run limits.

Planned additional scope: `step_id` becomes optional. Without it, the run is
retried from the start of its workflow, with the same input.

> Implementation note: the app calls `Lightning.WorkOrders.retry/3` (run id,
> step id, `created_by:` actor) through a session-cookie route,
> `POST /projects/:project_id/runs/:run_id/retry`
> (`LightningWeb.WorkflowController.retry_run/2`).
> `Lightning.WorkOrders.retry_many/2` retries several work orders at once.
> Differences: `retry/3` returns `{:error, :workflow_deleted}` as an atom and
> raises if the step isn't in the run, the controller checks run limits before
> calling it, and the cookie route answers in its own shape.

## List a run's steps

Status: **Private**

```
GET /api/runs/:id/steps
GET /api/runs/:id/steps?job_id=:job_id
```

Tokens: personal access token.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "steps",
      "id": "…",
      "attributes": {
        "job_id": "…",
        "exit_reason": "success",
        "error_type": null,
        "started_at": "…",
        "finished_at": "…",
        "input_dataclip_id": "…",
        "output_dataclip_id": "…"
      },
      "relationships": {},
      "links": {}
    }
  ],
  "included": [],
  "links": { "self": "…" }
}
```

Steps are in the order they ran. Not paged.

Planned additional scope: `job_name` and `adaptor` on each step, read from the
snapshot the step ran on, so a step can be labelled after its job is renamed or
deleted.

> Implementation note: `Lightning.Runs.get/2` with `include: [steps: []]`
> loads a run with its steps. The app reads them through a session-cookie
> route, `GET /projects/:project_id/runs/:run_id/steps`
> (`LightningWeb.WorkflowController.get_run_steps/2`). Differences: the cookie
> route requires `job_id` and returns that one step in its own shape, where the
> spec returns a list and makes `job_id` an optional filter.
