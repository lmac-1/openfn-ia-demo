# CLAUDE.md

## Project overview

A clean React replica of OpenFn Lightning's UI, built page for page against
the behaviour audit in OpenFn/lightning (`annotations/INVENTORY.md`, branch
`claude/tender-mendel-0pejfc`). React + TypeScript, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4.

**No backend logic.** Every page renders from static fixtures in
`src/mock-data/`. Interactions that would hit the server (save, delete,
invite, run) only change local React state, or do nothing. The next step is
cross-referencing each page with its annotation and wiring it to the backend,
so keep pages easy to wire: data comes in through mock-data helpers, not
inline literals scattered through the markup. See **The data seam** below.

**How pages behave** (pending, failure, server-driven lists, loading states)
is in [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md). Read it before adding a mutation or a
list page; `src/pages/profile/TokensPage.tsx` (props only) and its
`TokensPage.replica.tsx` wrapper (fake data, URL, toasts) are the worked
example. A page that will move to Lightning follows pattern 11, page and
wrapper.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — typecheck and build
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `npm run storybook` — start Storybook on port 6006
- `npm run build-storybook` — build Storybook static site
- `npm run compare:all` — set up a local Lightning and compare it with the
  replica, screen by screen. See **Comparing with Lightning** below.
- `npm run kickstart:sync` — regenerate the shared projects from
  `kickstart/exports/` (fixtures here, Kickstart scenario for Lightning).
- `node scripts/design-system-metrics.mjs` — count styling outside the
  primitives (className lists, distinct Tailwind tokens, raw elements). Run it
  before and after design-system work; the numbers should go down.

## Layout

- `src/App.tsx` — the route table. Every route is a Lightning URL
  (`lib/lightning_web/router.ex`), commented with its INVENTORY.md id.
- `src/pages/<area>/` — one file per Lightning view. Named after the
  inventory id (e.g. `history-work-orders` → `HistoryWorkOrdersPage.tsx`).
  A view that follows pattern 11 (page and wrapper) adds a
  `<Name>.replica.tsx` wrapper beside it, and `App.tsx` routes to that.
- `src/components/` — the component library: primitives at the top level,
  app chrome (sidebar, project picker, user menu) in `shell/`, feature
  components in area subfolders. See **Components** below.
- `src/types/` — the record types (`User`, `Project`, `WorkOrder`, …), one
  file per area. Types only.
- `src/constants.ts` — Lightning's fixed vocabulary: option lists, labels and
  copy hard-coded in its source (`historyStatuses`, `collaboratorRoles`, …).
- `src/utils/format.ts` — every date, duration, size, id and name formatter
  (`capitalize`, `shortUuid`, `fullName`, …). Add new ones here, not in an area folder.
  Other shared helpers sit beside it: `search.ts` (`matchesQuery`),
  `validate.ts` (`isValidEmail`), `useUrlParams.ts`, `useCopy.ts`, and pure
  domain helpers per area (`adaptors.ts`, `history.ts`, `urls.ts`,
  `workflowGraph.ts`).
- `src/permissions.ts` — `permissionsFor(project, user)`: every `can*` flag,
  mirroring Lightning's policies (`lib/lightning/policies/`).
- `src/session/` — the signed-in user and instance details:
  `useCurrentUser()`, `useInstanceInfo()`, `usePermissions(project)`.
- `src/mock-data/` — the fake database: fixtures modelled on Lightning's demo
  seed (`lib/lightning/setup_utils.ex`) and the queries over them (`findProject`,
  `workOrdersIn`, …). No types, no pure helpers.
  `generated/kickstart.ts` is generated from the project exports in
  `kickstart/exports/` by `npm run kickstart:sync`, which also writes the
  Kickstart scenario that loads the same projects into a local Lightning
  (`kickstart/README.md`). Don't edit it by hand.
- `src/theme/` — themes, chosen from the settings button (bottom right).
  Lightning v2 is the default.
- `annotations/` — a copy of the behaviour audit from OpenFn/lightning
  (`annotations/SOURCE.md` says which commit). The annotations panel, opened
  from the settings button, shows the annotation for the element under the
  mouse: the nearest `data-annotation="<id>"`, else the page's view id
  (`src/annotations/viewIds.ts`). Put `data-annotation` on any sub-panel that
  has its own inventory or shared id. To update, replace the folder with the
  branch's current `annotations/` and update SOURCE.md.

## Matching Lightning

This repo is becoming the React frontend that replaces Lightning's
LiveView UI, so Lightning is the source of truth for **what** a page does,
not **how** it's built.

- **Copy behaviour and content exactly.** Find the view in OpenFn/lightning
  (paths are in INVENTORY.md) and match its headings, labels, button text,
  empty states, column names and order, and what each action does.
- **Don't copy its implementation.** Lightning mixes LiveView components,
  the collaborative editor's React components and a half-started new design
  system. Don't port those splits. Build every page from the primitives
  below, and when two Lightning screens style the same thing differently,
  pick one treatment in the primitive rather than copying both.
- One neutral scale: `gray-*`. No `slate`, `zinc` or `secondary`. Brand
  colour is `primary-*` (indigo; don't write `indigo-*`). `info`, `success`,
  `danger`, `warning` are defined in `src/index.css`.
- Icons are Heroicons as CSS classes: `<span className="hero-folder h-5 w-5" />`,
  with `-solid`, `-mini` and `-micro` suffixes. No icon packages.
- Use `cn()` from `src/utils/cn.ts` for conditional classes.
- Every page is `<PageContent header={<Header … />}>` with a `<Centered>`
  body, unless the page needs a different layout.

### Comparing with Lightning

When asked to "compare with Lightning" (or to check a page against it, or to
load a project export), follow the `compare-with-lightning` skill
(`.claude/skills/compare-with-lightning/SKILL.md`). The short version:
`npm run compare:all` sets up a local Lightning `main` on the demo seed plus
the shared projects from `kickstart/exports/`, starts the replica, and writes
side-by-side screenshots and wording reports to `compare-out/`. Read the
reports, open every shot, then fix wording and behaviour differences. Ignore
visual drift and the richer fixture data. Add new screens to the specs in
`scripts/compare-lightning/specs/` so the next run covers them.

## Components

The design system has two layers.

**Primitives** (`src/components/*.tsx`) are small, general and used
everywhere. Reach for these first:

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| An action | `Button` (`to` for routes, `href` for plain links; `size="xs" theme="secondary"` for table row actions; `pending` while its request runs) |
| A request in flight | `useAction` from `utils/useAction.ts` (pending, error, double-click guard); `Spinner` for anything loading |
| An icon-only action | `IconButton` (always give it a `label`; `to`/`href` for icon links, `external` to open `href` in a new tab, `tone="danger"`, or pass an SVG element as `icon`) |
| A button that opens a menu | `ButtonMenu`; `SplitButton` when the button also has its own action |
| A form control | `TextInput`, `PasswordInput`, `TextArea`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Radio` from `Inputs` (`fieldClassName` styles the wrapper, e.g. `flex-1` in a row); wrap anything else in `Field` with `controlClasses()` and `data-ui="field"` |
| A name that becomes a URL-safe slug | `NameField` (input plus the "will be named" badge) |
| A dialog | `Modal` (`size`, or `bare` for custom layouts) |
| A dialog around one form | `FormModal` (`formId`, async `onSubmit`, `submitLabel`; Enter submits, Cancel is built in, pending and failure shown) |
| Confirming one action | `ConfirmModal`; `confirmation` adds a type-to-confirm field |
| A list of actions or choices | `Menu` with `MenuItem`, `MenuSection`, `MenuDivider` |
| A floating panel (filters, details) | `Popover` (`panelProps` puts `data-annotation` on the portalled panel; Menu takes it too) |
| A searchable list you pick from with the keyboard | `SearchList` |
| Show / hide a section | `Disclosure` (`card`, `section` or `inline`) |
| Switching views | `Tabs` (`underline` or `pill`, horizontal or vertical, buttons or route links) |
| Searching or filtering a list | `SearchInput` |
| A status chip, badge or tag | `Pill` (`color`, `square`, `mono`; `onRemove` makes it removable) |
| Any bordered panel, tile or card | `Card` (`title`/`description`/`action` give it a header; `padding`, `muted`, `dashed`) |
| A heading inside a page | `Heading` (`size` xl/lg/md/sm/eyebrow, `as` for the level) |
| Labelled values | `DetailList` + `DetailItem` (`rows` or `grid`) |
| A timestamp | `DateTime` |
| A short work order, run or dataclip id | `UuidChip` (`to` links it, `length={7}` in the workflow editor) |
| An on/off switch | `Toggle` (`note` adds gray text after the label) |
| An inline link | `TextLink` (`variant="danger"` for destructive ones) |
| Tabular data | `Table` with `Tr`, `Th`, `Td`, `EmptyState` (dashed box, or `variant="plain"` for centred text inside a card or list; `title`, `children` below the message) (a clickable `Tr` ignores clicks on links and buttons inside it, so no `stopPropagation`; `<Th actions />` and `<Td actions>` for the row-actions column, `align` for right/centre) |
| Sorting and filtering a table in the browser | `useTableSort` (or `useSort` for state only, when rows are sorted elsewhere) from `useTableSort.ts` |
| "Projects (3)" above a table, with its buttons | `TableTitle` |
| A status message | `Alert` |
| Page frame | `PageContent`, `Header`, `Centered`, `Breadcrumbs` |

Primitives expose their look to the themes through `data-ui` (and
`data-variant` for a variant or tone). Theme CSS targets those hooks, never
element selectors or utility classes, so a new primitive or variant needs its
hook, and the GDS theme is worth a look after styling changes.

Dialogs, menus and popovers sit on Headless UI (`@headlessui/react`), which
handles focus, keyboard and positioning. Don't hand-roll `fixed inset-0`
overlays, click-outside handlers or `absolute` dropdown panels.

**Feature components** (`src/components/<area>/`) are one panel or section
of a page (`WorkOrdersTable`, `WebhookSecurityPanel`). They're often used
once, and that's fine: they're the unit we wire to the backend and annotate.
They compose primitives and don't carry their own button, input, modal or
menu styling.

- **Pages compose components** and hold state, route params and mock-data
  queries. No styled raw `<button>`, `<input>` or `<table>` in pages. Under
  pattern 11 the `.replica.tsx` wrapper holds those, and the page only takes
  props.
- **Components never import `src/mock-data/`** (ESLint enforces it; stories
  are exempt). They take records and `can*` booleans as props. See **The data
  seam** below.
- **Need something that doesn't exist yet?** If it's general, add or extend a
  primitive. If it's specific to an area, make a feature component. Either
  way, add its story first.
- When a pattern repeats across three or more feature components, it's a
  primitive waiting to happen. Promote it.
- Before adding a variant to a feature component, check whether a primitive
  already covers it. Prefer a slightly different look over a second
  implementation.
- Use Tailwind's scale, not arbitrary values (`text-[13px]`, `max-w-[15rem]`),
  except for real geometry such as the workflow diagram.
- Button labels follow Lightning's own wording, not a house style.

## The data seam

Wiring the backend should only touch files that import `src/mock-data/`:
pages, `main.tsx` (the session) and a short, labelled list of components.

- **Data** comes in through pages. A page queries mock-data and passes records
  down. When a component needs a join Lightning preloads (a work order's runs,
  a project's owner), give the record type the joined field
  (`HistoryWorkOrder`, `AdminProjectRow`) and build it in the mock-data query.
- **Pattern 11 pages** narrow the seam to one file: only the `.replica.tsx`
  wrapper imports mock-data. Wiring that page means writing a Lightning
  wrapper; the page file doesn't change.
- **The current user** comes from `useCurrentUser()`, never a fixture import.
- **Permissions** come from `permissionsFor(project, user)` (or
  `usePermissions(project)`) in the page, passed down as booleans, the way
  Lightning's views assign `can_*` at mount. No inline role checks.
- **Exceptions** are components that still read fixtures. Each import says
  why: `// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-imports -- wiring: …`.
  `grep -rn "wiring:" src/components` lists them. Don't add one without a reason
  the next person can act on.

## Storybook

Every component has a `.stories.tsx` next to it.

- **New component** → create a story with a default and meaningful variants.
- **Changed props** → update the story args.
- **Deleted component** → delete its story.
- **Router-dependent components** → use `withRouter` / `withRouterAt` from
  `src/stories/decorators.tsx`.
- **Wrappers** (a gray page background, a right-hand side panel, a white
  card, a diagram canvas) → `withGrayPanel`, `withSidePanel`,
  `withWhitePanel`, `withCanvas` from the same file, not inline divs.
- Stories use fixtures from `src/mock-data/`; every story is signed in as
  `session.user` (`.storybook/preview.tsx`).

Run `npm run build-storybook` to verify stories compile. CI runs it on every PR.
